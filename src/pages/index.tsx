        On this site I have some links with answers to common questions about Islam.
        </p>
        <h3>
        Why would you be interested in Islam?
        </h3>
        <p>
        From your perspective, the important things in life for you are probably, exams if you're a student, if not maybe career progress, money, relationships, etc, and if Islam isn't going to get you those things, then why should you be interested? Good question. Well that's the information you will find on this site will require you to be honest with yourself. Can you consume this information objectively?

      <h3>
        Why am I interested in telling people about Islam?
        </h3>
      <p>
       Well the prophet ï·º said, "Ballighu 'anni walau aayah" which means "Convey from me even if it is one verse" and so I'm just trying to do that.
